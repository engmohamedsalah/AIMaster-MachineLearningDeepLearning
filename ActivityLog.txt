27/6
Repo initiated and discussions begin.

---

30/6
Dataset 1 is explored by both of us, including correlation factors, boxplots.

---

7/1
Columns are pre-processed by both of us, including one-hot encoding, random sample imputation and MinMax scaling.

---

2/7
Jack makes a decision tree and finds it effective, with max depth of 3.

---

6/7
Mohamed makes a random forest ensemble and uses GridSearch to optimise parameters. Accuracy of 96.7%. Also includes confusion matrix.
Jack adds cross validation to further verify the model.

---

7/7
Both of us work on functions to reorganise the dataset2 splits so that all the numbers are present in each set.

---

8/7
Jack tries an initial Xception model on digits 0-99 and finds it only partially effective.

---

13/7
We return to utlising the data in the orginal splits provided.
Mohamed makes a model which predicts each of the digits separately, very successful.

---

15/7
Jack uses thresholding to make a small improvement to Mohamed's model test performance.

---

24/7
Mohamed develops the model and adds confusion matrix.
Jack tries lowering the threshold value and adding batch normalisation layers.
Mohamed finds great success with increasing epochs and number of filters.
We begin thinking about creating and compiling the submission files.
