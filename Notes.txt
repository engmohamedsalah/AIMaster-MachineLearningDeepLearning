Brief:

Task 1

1. (DONE) Load and preprocess the dataset for the classification problem (handle missing data, convert categorical features to numerical features).
2. (DONE) Build a classifier for the classification problem using one of the specified models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or artificial neural networks).
3. (DONE) Fine-tune the selected model using appropriate techniques (eg, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, etc).
4. (DONE) Visualise the dataset and / or the model's results, where applicable (eg, feature importance, confusion matrix, etc).
5. (DONE) Report the final performance of the selected model using appropriate performance metrics (eg, accuracy, F1-score, etc).

Task 2

1. Load and preprocess the dataset for the multi-label image-based digit classification problem (normalise pixel values, resize images if necessary, etc).
2. Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the multi-label image-based digit classification task.
3. Fine-tune the CNN model using appropriate techniques (eg, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, etc).
4. Visualise the dataset and / or the CNN model's results, where applicable (eg, feature maps, learning curves, etc).
5. Report the final performance of the CNN model using appropriate performance metrics (eg, accuracy, F1-score, etc).
6. Collaborate within the team and decide on the best model (for classification) and CNN architecture (for digit recognition).
7. Submit the code as Jupyter Notebooks.
