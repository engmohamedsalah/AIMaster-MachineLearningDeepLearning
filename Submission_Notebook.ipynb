    "- The code you produce to solve the above tasks should make good use of structure, logic and commenting to be clear and robust.\n",
    "- Variable names should be thoughtfully considered and appropriate for the purpose. Ensure that scope conflicts are avoided, and that variable names donâ€™t leak into other code areas. It will help to consider how the structures covered throughout the module may be used. Similarly, it would be best to be mindful of error handling where appropriate.\n",
    "- The use of markdown cells is advised to keep a clear distinction between tasks.\n",
    "- It is expected that you will use commenting in markdown cells to explain how you have handled the task.\n",
    "- This notebook should include detailed comments that outline the individual contributions of each team member, the learning experiences that resulted from collaboration, and the reasoning behind the choice of the final models. Be sure to mention any specific insights or improvements gained through your collaborative efforts.\n",
    "- Use only your student ID number to identify yourself. Do not include your name in your coursework or the file name."
